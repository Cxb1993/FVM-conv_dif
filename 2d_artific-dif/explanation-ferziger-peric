The Upwind-Differencing Scheme on a uniform grid in both x and y gives a 
very simple equation that is readily solved in a sequential manner without 
iteration. On the other hand, the CDS gives a zero value for the coefficient
on the main diagonal, A_P, making the solution difficult. Most iterative 
solvers would fail to converge for this problem; however, by using the 
deferred correction approach described above, it is possible to obtain the 
solution [1].
